**Short Description**

Learn to read .xls, .csv, and text files in R using readxl and gdata,
before learning how to use readr and data.table packages to import flat
file data.

**Long Description**

Importing data into R should be the easiest step in your analysis.
Unfortunately, that is almost never the case. Data can come in many
formats, ranging from .csv and text files, to statistical software
files, to databases and HTML data. Knowing which approach to use is key
to getting started with the actual analysis.this course, you???ll start by
learning how to read .csv and text files in R. You will then cover the
readr and data.table packages to easily and efficiently import flat file
data. After that, you will learn how to read .xls files in R using
readxl and gdata.

# 1. Importing data from flat files with utils

A lot of data comes in the form of flat files: simple tabular text
files. Learn how to import the common formats of flat file data with
base R functions.

## Introduction & read.csv

Theory. Coming soon ???

**1. Introduction & read.csv**

Hi, and welcome to the first importing data in R course.

**2. Importing data in R**

Imagine this situation: A colleague of yours is still doing his analyses
in Excel and finally decided to transition to R. He needs an easy way to
convert the Excel spreadsheets into R data frames,

**3. Importing data in R**

but he can???t seem to find the tools to do so. Well, getting to know
these tools is exactly what we???ll do here.

**4. 5 types**

In this two-part course, we will focus on 5 types of data:

**5. 5 types**

data from flat files,

**6. 5 types**

data from Excel,

**7. 5 types**

data from databases,

**8. 5 types**

data from the web,

**9. 5 types**

and finally data from other statistical software like SAS, SPSS, and
Stata.

**10. 5 types**

You???ll learn to convert each data format, one after the other, into an R
data frame, ready to do some fancy analyses.

**11. Flat files**

Let???s start off with flat files. Flat files are typically simple text
files that display data as tables. Have a look at this example,
states-dot-csv, a flat file where CSV stands for comma-separated values.
The data lists basic information on some US states. The first line here
gives the names of the different columns or fields. After that, each
line is a record, and the fields are separated by a comma, hence the
extension CSV. For example, there???s the state Hawaii with the capital
Honolulu and a total population of 1-point-42 million. What would this
data look like in R? Well, actually, the structure nicely corresponds to
a data frame in R, that ideally looks like this: the rows in the data
frame correspond to the records and the columns of the data frame
correspond to the fields. The field names are used to name the columns
of the data frame. But how to go from the CSV file to this data frame?
We???re in luck, because the standard distribution of R provides
functionality to import these flat files into R as a data frame.

**12. utils - read.csv**

These functions belong to the utils package that is loaded by default
when you start R. More specifically, we???ll need the read-dot-csv
function, as follows: The first argument of read-dot-csv is the path to
the file you want to import in R. If the file is in your current working
directory, simply passing the filename as a character string works. If
your file is located somewhere else, things get tricky. Depending on the
platform you???re working on, Linux, Microsoft, Mac, whatever, file paths
are specified differently. To build a path to a file in a
platform-independent way, you can use the file-dot-path function.
Suppose our states-dot-csv file is located in the datasets folder of the
home directory. You can use file-dot-path like this: Because I???m working
on a Mac, this is the resulting path. I can now use this path inside
read-dot-csv to point to the correct file, like this. The second
argument, stringsAsFactors, is pretty important. Say we have columns
that are strings. We can choose to import these columns as actual
strings, or as factors, which R uses to store categorical variables. By
default, the stringsAsFactors argument is TRUE, so it would convert
strings into factors. In our case, however, the state and capital names
shouldn???t be categorical variables, so we set stringsAsFactors to FALSE.

**13. read.csv()**

If we run this call now, we can see we get a data frame with 5
observations and 4 variables. This corresponds nicely to the CSV file we
started with. If we print out the structure of this data frame, with
str, we see that indeed, the two first columns are strings, and not
factors, exactly like we wanted it!

## read.csv

The `utils` package, which is automatically loaded in your R session on
startup, can import CSV files with the
<a href="http://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/utils/functions/read.table" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">`read.csv()`</a>
function.

In this exercise, you???ll be working with
<a href="http://s3.amazonaws.com/assets.datacamp.com/production/course_1477/datasets/swimming_pools.csv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">`swimming_pools.csv`</a>;
it contains data on swimming pools in Brisbane, Australia (Source:
<a href="https://data.gov.au/dataset/swimming-pools-brisbane-city-council" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">data.gov.au</a>).
The file contains the column names in the first row. It uses a comma to
separate values within rows.

Type
<a href="http://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/base/functions/list.files" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">`dir()`</a>
in the console to list the files in your working directory. You???ll see
that it contains `swimming_pools.csv`, so you can start straight away.

**Steps**

1.  Use
    <a href="http://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/utils/functions/read.table" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">`read.csv()`</a>
    to import `"swimming_pools.csv"` as a data frame with the name
    `pools`.
2.  Print the structure of `pools` using
    <a href="http://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/utils/functions/str" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">`str()`</a>.

``` r
# Import swimming_pools.csv: pools
pools <- read.csv("data/swimming_pools.csv")

# Print the structure of pools
str(pools)
```

    ## 'data.frame':    20 obs. of  4 variables:
    ##  $ Name     : chr  "Acacia Ridge Leisure Centre" "Bellbowrie Pool" "Carole Park" "Centenary Pool (inner City)" ...
    ##  $ Address  : chr  "1391 Beaudesert Road, Acacia Ridge" "Sugarwood Street, Bellbowrie" "Cnr Boundary Road and Waterford Road Wacol" "400 Gregory Terrace, Spring Hill" ...
    ##  $ Latitude : num  -27.6 -27.6 -27.6 -27.5 -27.4 ...
    ##  $ Longitude: num  153 153 153 153 153 ...

## stringsAsFactors

With `stringsAsFactors`, you can tell R whether it should convert
strings in the flat file to factors.

For all importing functions in the `utils` package, this argument is
`TRUE`, which means that you import strings as factors. This only makes
sense if the strings you import represent categorical variables in R. If
you set `stringsAsFactors` to `FALSE`, the data frame columns
corresponding to strings in your text file will be `character`.

You???ll again be working with the
<a href="http://s3.amazonaws.com/assets.datacamp.com/production/course_1477/datasets/swimming_pools.csv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">`swimming_pools.csv`</a>
file. It contains two columns (`Name` and `Address`), which shouldn???t be
factors.

**Steps**

1.  Use `read.csv()` to import the data in
    <a href="http://s3.amazonaws.com/assets.datacamp.com/production/course_1477/datasets/swimming_pools.csv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">`"swimming_pools.csv"`</a>
    as a data frame called `pools`; make sure that strings are imported
    as characters, not as factors.
2.  Using
    <a href="http://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/utils/functions/str" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">`str()`</a>,
    display the structure of the dataset and check that you indeed get
    character vectors instead of factors.

``` r
# Import swimming_pools.csv correctly: pools
pools <- read.csv("data/swimming_pools.csv", stringsAsFactors = F)

# Check the structure of pools
str(pools)
```

    ## 'data.frame':    20 obs. of  4 variables:
    ##  $ Name     : chr  "Acacia Ridge Leisure Centre" "Bellbowrie Pool" "Carole Park" "Centenary Pool (inner City)" ...
    ##  $ Address  : chr  "1391 Beaudesert Road, Acacia Ridge" "Sugarwood Street, Bellbowrie" "Cnr Boundary Road and Waterford Road Wacol" "400 Gregory Terrace, Spring Hill" ...
    ##  $ Latitude : num  -27.6 -27.6 -27.6 -27.5 -27.4 ...
    ##  $ Longitude: num  153 153 153 153 153 ...

## Any changes?

Consider the code below that loads data from `swimming_pools.csv` in two
distinct ways:

``` r
# Option A
pools <- read.csv("swimming_pools.csv", stringsAsFactors = TRUE)

# Option B
pools <- read.csv("swimming_pools.csv", stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
```

> ## *Question*
>
> How many variables in the resulting `pools` data frame have different
> types if you specify the `stringsAsFactors` argument differently?<br>
> <br> ??? Just one: `Name`.<br> ??? Two variables: `Name` and
> `Address`.<br> ??? Three columns: all but `Longitude`.<br> ??? All four
> of them!<br>

## read.delim & read.table

Theory. Coming soon ???

**1. read.delim & read.table**

In the previous video you learned about read-dot-csv, which is an R
function that specifically exists for importing CSV data. However, flat
file data doesn???t come as comma separated values alone.

**2. Tab-delimited file**

Another common format of flat file data is the tab-delimited file, like
this states-dot-txt, with the same data as before:To import it, we???ll
need read-dot-delim this time. As usual, you simply specify the path to
the file, and also that we want to import strings as strings, and not as
factors. Works like a charm!If your data comes in this typical comma
separated or tab-delimited format, your life is easy and importing the
data is a walk in the park. If it???s not, you???ll have to some more
customization work.

**3. Exotic file format**

Say we have the same states data again, but this time, the values are
separated by a forward slash instead of commas or tabs, in a file
states2.txt. How to go about this? read-dot-csv and read-dot-delim won???t
do you much good in this case.

**4. read.table()**

Here, you???ll want to use read-dot-table. It???s the main importing
function in the utils package, allowing you to read in any file in table
format and create a data frame from it.The number of arguments you can
specify for this function is huge, so I won???t go through each and every
one of these arguments. Instead, let???s have a look at the read-dot-table
call that imports states2.txt and try to understand what happens.As
usual, the first argument is the path to the file you want to import.The
header argument is something we haven???t seen before. If you set this to
TRUE, you tell R that the first row of the text file contains the
variable names, which is the case here. read-dot-table sets this
argument to FALSE by default, which would mean that the first row is
always read as an observation, even if it???s a row of variable
names.Next, sep is the argument that specifies how fields in a record
are separated. For our file here, the field separator is a forward
slash, like this.Finally, there???s again the stringsAsFactors argument,
which we set to FALSE again because we want to import strings as
strings. The result looks just as we???d want, nice!Apart from the
arguments we discussed here, there are also ways to specify column names
and column types.

## read.delim

Aside from `.csv` files, there are also the `.txt` files which are
basically text files. You can import these functions with
<a href="http://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/utils/functions/read.table" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">`read.delim()`</a>.
By default, it sets the `sep` argument to `"\t"` (fields in a record are
delimited by tabs) and the `header` argument to `TRUE` (the first row
contains the field names).

In this exercise, you will import
<a href="http://s3.amazonaws.com/assets.datacamp.com/production/course_1477/datasets/hotdogs.txt" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">`hotdogs.txt`</a>,
containing information on sodium and calorie levels in different hotdogs
(Source:
<a href="http://wiki.stat.ucla.edu/socr/index.php/SOCR_012708_ID_Data_HotDogs" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">UCLA</a>).
The dataset has 3 variables, but the variable names are *not* available
in the first line of the file. The file uses tabs as field separators.

**Steps**

1.  Import the data in `"hotdogs.txt"` with
    <a href="http://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/utils/functions/read.table" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">`read.delim()`</a>.
    Call the resulting data frame `hotdogs`. The variable names are
    **not** on the first line, so make sure to set the `header` argument
    appropriately.
2.  Call
    <a href="http://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/base/functions/summary" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">`summary()`</a>
    on `hotdogs`. This will print out some summary statistics about all
    variables in the data frame.

``` r
# Import hotdogs.txt: hotdogs
hotdogs <- read.delim("data/hotdogs.txt", header = F)

# Summarize hotdogs
summary(hotdogs)
```

    ##       V1                  V2              V3       
    ##  Length:54          Min.   : 86.0   Min.   :144.0  
    ##  Class :character   1st Qu.:132.0   1st Qu.:362.5  
    ##  Mode  :character   Median :145.0   Median :405.0  
    ##                     Mean   :145.4   Mean   :424.8  
    ##                     3rd Qu.:172.8   3rd Qu.:503.5  
    ##                     Max.   :195.0   Max.   :645.0

## read.table

If you???re dealing with more exotic flat file formats, you???ll want to use
<a href="http://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/utils/functions/read.table" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">`read.table()`</a>.
It???s the most basic importing function; you can specify tons of
different arguments in this function. Unlike
<a href="http://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/utils/functions/read.table" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">`read.csv()`</a>
and
<a href="http://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/utils/functions/read.table" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">`read.delim()`</a>,
the `header` argument defaults to `FALSE` and the `sep` argument is `""`
by default.

Up to you again! The data is still
<a href="http://s3.amazonaws.com/assets.datacamp.com/production/course_1477/datasets/hotdogs.txt" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">`hotdogs.txt`</a>.
It has no column names in the first row, and the field separators are
tabs. This time, though, the file is in the `data` folder inside your
current working directory. A variable `path` with the location of this
file is already coded for you.

**Steps**

1.  Finish the `read.table()` call that???s been prepared for you. Use the
    `path` variable, and make sure to set `sep` correctly.
2.  Call `head()` on `hotdogs`; this will print the first 6 observations
    in the data frame.

``` r
# Path to the hotdogs.txt file: path
path <- file.path("data", "hotdogs.txt")

# Import the hotdogs.txt file: hotdogs
hotdogs <- read.table(path, 
                      sep = "\t", 
                      col.names = c("type", "calories", "sodium"))

# Call head() on hotdogs
head(hotdogs)
```

    ##   type calories sodium
    ## 1 Beef      186    495
    ## 2 Beef      181    477
    ## 3 Beef      176    425
    ## 4 Beef      149    322
    ## 5 Beef      184    482
    ## 6 Beef      190    587

Great! No need to specify the `header` argument: it is `FALSE` by
default for `read.table()`, which is exactly what you want here.

## Arguments

Lily and Tom are having an argument because they want to share a hot dog
but they can???t seem to agree on which one to choose. After some time,
they simply decide that they will have one each. Lily wants to have the
one with the fewest calories while Tom wants to have the one with the
most sodium.

Next to `calories` and `sodium`, the hotdogs have one more variable:
`type`. This can be one of three things: `Beef`, `Meat`, or `Poultry`,
so a categorical variable: a factor is fine.

**Steps**

1.  Finish the `read.delim()` call to import the data in
    <a href="http://s3.amazonaws.com/assets.datacamp.com/production/course_1477/datasets/hotdogs.txt" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">`"hotdogs.txt"`</a>.
    It???s a tab-delimited file without names in the first row.
2.  The code that selects the observation with the lowest calorie count
    and stores it in the variable `lily` is already available. It uses
    the function
    <a href="http://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/base/functions/which.min" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">`which.min()`</a>,
    that returns the index the smallest value in a vector.
3.  Do a similar thing for Tom: select the observation with the *most
    sodium* and store it in `tom`. Use
    <a href="http://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/base/functions/which.min" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">`which.max()`</a>
    this time.
4.  Finally, print both the observations `lily` and `tom`.

``` r
# Finish the read.delim() call
hotdogs <- read.delim("data/hotdogs.txt", header = F, col.names = c("type", "calories", "sodium"))

# Select the hot dog with the least calories: lily
lily <- hotdogs[which.min(hotdogs$calories), ]

# Select the observation with the most sodium: tom
tom <- hotdogs[which.max(hotdogs$sodium),]

# Print lily and tom
lily
```

    ##       type calories sodium
    ## 50 Poultry       86    358

``` r
tom
```

    ##    type calories sodium
    ## 15 Beef      190    645

## Column classes

Next to column names, you can also specify the column types or column
classes of the resulting data frame. You can do this by setting the
`colClasses` argument to a vector of strings representing classes:

``` r
read.delim("data/my_file.txt", 
           colClasses = c("character",
                          "numeric",
                          "logical"))
```

This approach can be useful if you have some columns that should be
factors and others that should be characters. You don???t have to bother
with `stringsAsFactors` anymore; just state for each column what the
class should be.

If a column is set to `"NULL"` in the `colClasses` vector, this column
will be skipped and will not be loaded into the data frame.

**Steps**

1.  The `read.delim()` call from before is already included and creates
    the `hotdogs` data frame. Go ahead and display the structure of
    `hotdogs`.
2.  **Edit** the second
    <a href="http://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/utils/functions/read.table" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">`read.delim()`</a>
    call. Assign the correct vector to the `colClasses` argument. `NA`
    should be replaced with a character vector:
    `c("factor", "NULL", "numeric")`.
3.  Display the structure of `hotdogs2` and look for the difference.

``` r
# Previous call to import hotdogs.txt
hotdogs <- read.delim("data/hotdogs.txt", header = FALSE, col.names = c("type", "calories", "sodium"))

# Display structure of hotdogs
str(hotdogs)
```

    ## 'data.frame':    54 obs. of  3 variables:
    ##  $ type    : chr  "Beef" "Beef" "Beef" "Beef" ...
    ##  $ calories: int  186 181 176 149 184 190 158 139 175 148 ...
    ##  $ sodium  : int  495 477 425 322 482 587 370 322 479 375 ...

``` r
# Edit the colClasses argument to import the data correctly: hotdogs2
hotdogs2 <- read.delim("hotdogs.txt", header = FALSE, 
                       col.names = c("type", "calories", "sodium"),
                       colClasses = c("factor", "NULL", "numeric"))


# Display structure of hotdogs2
str(hotdogs2)
```

## Final Thoughts

Theory. Coming soon ???

**1. Final Thoughts**

There???s something I haven???t told you yet. When I said that
read-dot-table was utils??? main importing functions, I was serious.

**2. Wrappers**

Actually, read-dot-csv and read-dot-delim, the functions to import
comma-separated values and tab-delimited files, are so-called wrapper
functions around read-dot-table. They call read-dot-table behind the
scenes, but with different default arguments to match the specific
formats.

**3. read.csv**

For read-dot-csv, the default for header is TRUE and for sep is a comma,
so you don???t have to manually specify these anymore. This means that
this read-dot-table call to import the CSV version of states, is exactly
the same as this read-dot-csv call. Shorter and easier to read, if you
ask me.

**4. read.delim**

Likewise, read-dot-delim sets the header and sep argument, among some
others. This call to import the tab-delimited version of states, is
exactly the same as this read-dot-delim call.

**5. Documentation**

If you have a look at the documentation of read-dot-table, you???ll see
that there are two more functions in there that we haven???t discussed
yet. read-dot-csv2 and read-dot-delim2. These functions exist to deal
with regional differences in representing numbers.

**6. Locale differences**

Have a look at this csv file, states_aye-dot-csv, typical for the US and
Great Britain, and its counterpart, states_nay-dot-csv.You???ll notice
that the states_nay use commas for decimal points, as opposed to the dot
for states_aye-dot-csv. This means that they can???t use the comma as the
field-delimiter anymore, they need a semicolon.

**7. Locale differences**

That???s why the read-dot-csv2 and read-dot-delim2 functions exist. Can
you spot the difference in default arguments again?

**8. states_nay.csv**

Let???s try to import the states_nay-dot-csv file with the basic
read-dot-csv function.R gives a result, but it clearly is not the result
we want. It???s a dataset with 5 observations but a single variable.If we
try again with read-dot-csv2, it works perfectly this time!These were
just some side notes to wrap up on this chapter. By now, you now how to
import comma-separated, tab-delimited and even more exotic data formats.
But there???s much more to learn!

# 2. readr & data.table

In addition to base R, there are dedicated packages to easily and
efficiently import flat file data. We???ll talk about two such packages:
readr and data.table.

## readr: read_csv & read_tsv

Theory. Coming soon ???

**1. readr: read_csv & read_tsv**

By now, you already now how to import flat files using

**2. Overview**

the utils package. The utils package is loaded by default when you start
R. Of course, R wouldn???t be R if there aren???t specialized packages to
import your data. In this chapter, I???m going to talk about two such
packages: readr and data-dot-table.

**3. readr**

First, let???s dive into the ???readr??? package, written by Hadley Wickham!
It???s a fast and very easy to use package with very consistent naming,
while utils is more verbose and multiple times slower.We???ll start with
installing and loading the readr package, like this.

**4. CSV files**

Before, you used read dot csv to import CSV files as a data frame, like
this call, to import the states dot csv file. To do this the readr way,
you???ll want to use read underscore csv. This will do the trick:The
result is pretty much the same. The only difference is that read_delim
outputs a tibble, which is a supercharged version of a dataframe that
Hadley Wickham introduced; you can work with it as a normal data frame,
but can do additional stuff with it. The printout conveniently shows the
column classes. In general, all of Hadley???s packages work with tibbles;
whether or not they show this convienent printout depends on which
packages you have loaded in.In both calls, the first argument is the
path to the file you want to import. Notice that in readr, strings are
not imported as factors by default, so an equivalent of the
stringsAsFactors argument is not required.Remember that utils also
featured the read-dot-delim function to import tab-delimited files.

**5. TSV files**

This call imported states-dot-txt. readr also provides a similar
function, but it???s called read underscore tsv, short for tab separated
value. This is the call you need. Again, no need to specify
stringsAsFactors explicitly, which is practical.

**6. Wrapping in utils and readr**

Just like in utils, both the read_csv and read_tsv functions are
wrappers around a ???mother import function???,

**7. Wrapping in utils and readr**

called read_delim. This table summarizes how the wrapping works for
utils and readr, make sure not to mix things up.

**8. Let???s practice!**

I suggest you already head over to the exercises for some practice
before we dive into some more customization possibilities for
read_delim. I???ll see you again in the next video!

## read_csv

CSV files can be imported with
<a href="http://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/readr/versions/1.0.0/topics/read_delim" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">`read_csv()`</a>.
It???s a wrapper function around
<a href="http://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/readr/versions/1.0.0/topics/read_delim" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">`read_delim()`</a>
that handles all the details for you. For example, it will assume that
the first row contains the column names.

The dataset you???ll be working with here is
<a href="http://s3.amazonaws.com/assets.datacamp.com/production/course_1477/datasets/potatoes.csv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">`potatoes.csv`</a>.
It gives information on the impact of storage period and cooking on
potatoes??? flavor. It uses commas to delimit fields in a record, and
contains column names in the first row. The file is available in your
workspace. Remember that you can inspect your workspace with `dir()`.

**Steps**

1.  Load the `readr` package with
    <a href="http://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/base/functions/library" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">`library()`</a>.
    You **do not** need to install the package, it is already installed
    on DataCamp???s servers.
2.  Import `"potatoes.csv"` using `read_csv()`. Assign the resulting
    data frame to the variable `potatoes`.

``` r
# Load the readr package
library(readr)

# Import potatoes.csv with read_csv(): potatoes
potatoes <- read_csv("data/potatoes.csv")
```

    ## Rows: 160 Columns: 8
    ## ?????? Column specification ????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????
    ## Delimiter: ","
    ## dbl (8): area, temp, size, storage, method, texture, flavor, moistness
    ## 
    ## ??? Use `spec()` to retrieve the full column specification for this data.
    ## ??? Specify the column types or set `show_col_types = FALSE` to quiet this message.

## read_tsv

Where you use `read_csv()` to easily read in CSV files, you use
<a href="http://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/readr/versions/1.0.0/topics/read_delim" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">`read_tsv()`</a>
to easily read in TSV files. TSV is short for tab-separated values.

This time, the potatoes data comes in the form of a tab-separated values
file;
<a href="http://s3.amazonaws.com/assets.datacamp.com/production/course_1477/datasets/potatoes.txt" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">`potatoes.txt`</a>
is available in your workspace. In contrast to `potatoes.csv`, this file
does **not** contain columns names in the first row, though.

There???s a vector `properties` that you can use to specify these column
names manually.

**Steps**

1.  Use `read_tsv()` to import the potatoes data from `potatoes.txt` and
    store it in the data frame `potatoes`. In addition to the path to
    the file, you???ll also have to specify the `col_names` argument; you
    can use the `properties` vector for this.
2.  Call `head()` on `potatoes` to show the first observations of your
    dataset.

``` r
# Column names
properties <- c("area", "temp", "size", "storage", "method",
                "texture", "flavor", "moistness")

# Import potatoes.txt: potatoes
potatoes <- read_tsv("data/potatoes.txt" , col_names = properties)
```

    ## Rows: 160 Columns: 8
    ## ?????? Column specification ????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????
    ## Delimiter: "\t"
    ## dbl (8): area, temp, size, storage, method, texture, flavor, moistness
    ## 
    ## ??? Use `spec()` to retrieve the full column specification for this data.
    ## ??? Specify the column types or set `show_col_types = FALSE` to quiet this message.

``` r
# Call head() on potatoes
head(potatoes)
```

    ## # A tibble: 6 ?? 8
    ##    area  temp  size storage method texture flavor moistness
    ##   <dbl> <dbl> <dbl>   <dbl>  <dbl>   <dbl>  <dbl>     <dbl>
    ## 1     1     1     1       1      1     2.9    3.2       3  
    ## 2     1     1     1       1      2     2.3    2.5       2.6
    ## 3     1     1     1       1      3     2.5    2.8       2.8
    ## 4     1     1     1       1      4     2.1    2.9       2.4
    ## 5     1     1     1       1      5     1.9    2.8       2.2
    ## 6     1     1     1       2      1     1.8    3         1.7

## readr: read_delim

Theory. Coming soon ???

**1. readr: read_delim**

Remember the states2.txt file from before,

**2. states2.txt**

that uses forward slashes as separators? Before, we???ve already written

**3. states2.txt**

this customized read-dot-table call for it. Let???s now use readr???s more
low-level read_delim function to do the same thing:As usual, the first
argument is the path the file. Next, the delim argument specifies the
character that is used to separate fields within a record; it???s the
equivalent of the sep argument in read-dot-table.The output corresponds
to the output fo the read-dot-table call, but the readr version outputs
a tibble again.Let???s compare the utils and the readr calls here. First
off, we didn???t have to specify something like header is TRUE, because by
default, read_delim expects the first row to contain the column names.
It does this with the col_names argument. Also, strings are not imported
as factors by default, so a stringsAsFactors equivalent is not
necessary. To control the types of the columns, readr uses the col_types
argument, similar to the colClasses argument from utils. Let me dive
into col_names first, and then talk some more about col_types.

**4. col_names**

col_names is TRUE by default. Suppose you have another version of the
states file, without column names this time, states3.txt. The first line
is already a record now.

**5. col_names**

Setting col_names to FALSE, leads to automatic generation of column
names, like in this example. You can also manually set col_names to a
character vector. The names you pass will be used as the names of the
columns, and the first line is read as a record, like here:

**6. col_types**

Next, there???s also col_types, to control the column classes. If we just
import states2.txt, the file with header names, like before, without
specifying col_types, the column types will be guessed from the first 30
rows on the input. The printout of the tibble shows us the class of each
column, which is very practical. The first two columns are character,
the third is double, and the fourth is integer.You can also specify the
column classes manually. In this call, we enforce the state and city to
be a character and the population and area to be both numeric. I used
short string representations here: c stands for character, d for double
or numeric, i for integer, and l for logical. The result is what we???d
expect: the fourth column is a double now.Instead of c, d, i and l, you
can also use an underscore, to skip a column. A totally different way to
control the types of the columns is through collector functions.
Although more complicated, they are more versatile. You???ll learn more
about this in the exercises.

**7. skip and n_max**

If you???re working on huge flat files, say one million lines, you might
be interested in handling the data in chunks of 50-point-000 lines for
example. This keeps your work tractable and you can easily follow up on
the progress of your algorithms. In readr, You can do this with a
combination of the skip and n_max arguments. Have a look at the output
of this call:We skipped 2 rows, and then read in three records. There???s
a problem though! Because col_names is TRUE by default, the first row
that???s read is used for the column names, but this information has been
skipped! We???ll have to manually specify some column names this time, by
setting col_names to a character vector. This time, the two first rows,
so the column names and the first observation are skipped, and the next
three observations are read in. Perfect.

**8. Let???s practice!**

Let???s see your importing skills progress in the exercises. In the last
video of this chapter, we???ll talk about the amazing fread function from
the data-dot-table package!

## read_delim

Just as
<a href="http://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/utils/functions/read.table" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">`read.table()`</a>
was the main `utils` function,
<a href="http://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/readr/versions/1.0.0/topics/read_delim" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">`read_delim()`</a>
is the main `readr` function.

<a href="http://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/readr/versions/1.0.0/topics/read_delim" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">`read_delim()`</a>
takes two mandatory arguments:

-   `file`: the file that contains the data
-   `delim`: the character that separates the values in the data file

You???ll again be working
<a href="http://s3.amazonaws.com/assets.datacamp.com/production/course_1477/datasets/potatoes.txt" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">`potatoes.txt`</a>;
the file uses tabs (`"\t"`) to delimit values and does **not** contain
column names in its first line. It???s available in your working directory
so you can start right away. As before, the vector `properties` is
available to set the `col_names`.

**Steps**

1.  Import all the data in
    <a href="http://s3.amazonaws.com/assets.datacamp.com/production/course_1477/datasets/potatoes.txt" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">`"potatoes.txt"`</a>
    using
    <a href="http://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/readr/versions/1.0.0/topics/read_delim" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">`read_delim()`</a>;
    store the resulting data frame in `potatoes`.
2.  Print out `potatoes`.

``` r
# Column names
properties <- c("area", "temp", "size", "storage", "method",
                "texture", "flavor", "moistness")

# Import potatoes.txt using read_delim(): potatoes
potatoes <- read_delim("data/potatoes.txt", delim = "\t", col_names = properties)

# Print out potatoes
potatoes
```

Good job! Notice that you could just as well have used
[`read_tsv()`](http://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/readr/versions/1.0.0/topics/read_delim)
here.

## skip and n_max

Through `skip` and `n_max` you can control *which part* of your flat
file you???re actually importing into R.

-   `skip` specifies the number of lines you???re ignoring in the flat
    file before actually starting to import data.
-   `n_max` specifies the number of lines you???re actually importing.

Say for example you have a CSV file with 20 lines, and set `skip = 2`
and `n_max = 3`, you???re only reading in lines 3, 4 and 5 of the file.

Watch out: Once you `skip` some lines, you also skip the first line that
can contain column names!

<a href="http://s3.amazonaws.com/assets.datacamp.com/production/course_1477/datasets/potatoes.txt" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">`potatoes.txt`</a>,
a flat file with tab-delimited records and without column names, is
available in your workspace.

**Steps**

1.  Finish the first
    <a href="http://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/readr/versions/1.0.0/topics/read_delim" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">`read_tsv()`</a>
    call to import observations 7, 8, 9, 10 and 11 from `potatoes.txt`.

``` r
# Column names
properties <- c("area", "temp", "size", "storage", "method",
                "texture", "flavor", "moistness")

# Import 5 observations from potatoes.txt: potatoes_fragment
potatoes_fragment <- read_tsv("data/potatoes.txt", skip = 6, n_max = 5, col_names = properties)
```

    ## Rows: 5 Columns: 8
    ## ?????? Column specification ????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????
    ## Delimiter: "\t"
    ## dbl (8): area, temp, size, storage, method, texture, flavor, moistness
    ## 
    ## ??? Use `spec()` to retrieve the full column specification for this data.
    ## ??? Specify the column types or set `show_col_types = FALSE` to quiet this message.

## col_types

You can also specify which types the columns in your imported data frame
should have. You can do this with `col_types`. If set to `NULL`, the
default, functions from the `readr` package will try to find the correct
types themselves. You can manually set the types with a string, where
each character denotes the class of the column: `c`haracter, `d`ouble,
`i`nteger and `l`ogical. `_` skips the column as a whole.

<a href="http://s3.amazonaws.com/assets.datacamp.com/production/course_1477/datasets/potatoes.txt" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">`potatoes.txt`</a>,
a flat file with tab-delimited records and without column names, is
again available in your workspace.

**Steps**

1.  In the second
    <a href="http://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/readr/versions/1.0.0/topics/read_delim" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">`read_tsv()`</a>
    call, edit the `col_types` argument to import *all* columns as
    characters (`c`). Store the resulting data frame in `potatoes_char`.
2.  Print out the structure of `potatoes_char` and verify whether all
    column types are `chr`, short for `character`.

``` r
# Column names
properties <- c("area", "temp", "size", "storage", "method",
                "texture", "flavor", "moistness")

# Import all data, but force all columns to be character: potatoes_char
potatoes_char <- read_tsv("data/potatoes.txt", col_types = "cccccccc", col_names = properties)

# Print out structure of potatoes_char
str(potatoes_char)
```

    ## spec_tbl_df [160 ?? 8] (S3: spec_tbl_df/tbl_df/tbl/data.frame)
    ##  $ area     : chr [1:160] "1" "1" "1" "1" ...
    ##  $ temp     : chr [1:160] "1" "1" "1" "1" ...
    ##  $ size     : chr [1:160] "1" "1" "1" "1" ...
    ##  $ storage  : chr [1:160] "1" "1" "1" "1" ...
    ##  $ method   : chr [1:160] "1" "2" "3" "4" ...
    ##  $ texture  : chr [1:160] "2.9" "2.3" "2.5" "2.1" ...
    ##  $ flavor   : chr [1:160] "3.2" "2.5" "2.8" "2.9" ...
    ##  $ moistness: chr [1:160] "3.0" "2.6" "2.8" "2.4" ...
    ##  - attr(*, "spec")=
    ##   .. cols(
    ##   ..   area = col_character(),
    ##   ..   temp = col_character(),
    ##   ..   size = col_character(),
    ##   ..   storage = col_character(),
    ##   ..   method = col_character(),
    ##   ..   texture = col_character(),
    ##   ..   flavor = col_character(),
    ##   ..   moistness = col_character()
    ##   .. )
    ##  - attr(*, "problems")=<externalptr>

## col_types with collectors

Another way of setting the types of the imported columns is using
**collectors**. Collector functions can be passed in a
<a href="http://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/base/functions/list" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">`list()`</a>
to the `col_types` argument of `read_` functions to tell them how to
interpret values in a column.

For a complete list of collector functions, you can take a look at the
<a href="https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/readr/topics/collector" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">`collector`</a>
documentation. For this exercise you will need two collector functions:

-   `col_integer()`: the column should be interpreted as an integer.
-   `col_factor(levels, ordered = FALSE)`: the column should be
    interpreted as a factor with `levels`.

In this exercise, you will work with
<a href="http://s3.amazonaws.com/assets.datacamp.com/production/course_1477/datasets/hotdogs.txt" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">`hotdogs.txt`</a>,
which is a tab-delimited file without column names in the first row.

**Steps**

1.  `hotdogs` is created for you without setting the column types.
    Inspect its summary using the
    <a href="http://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/base/functions/summary" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">`summary()`</a>
    function.
2.  Two collector functions are defined for you: `fac` and `int`. Have a
    look at them, do you understand what they???re collecting?
3.  In the second `read_tsv()` call, edit the `col_types` argument: Pass
    a `list()` with the elements `fac`, `int` and `int`, so the first
    column is imported as a factor, and the second and third column as
    integers.
4.  Create a
    <a href="http://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/base/functions/summary" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">`summary()`</a>
    of `hotdogs_factor`. Compare this to the summary of `hotdogs`.

``` r
# Import without col_types
hotdogs <- read_tsv("data/hotdogs.txt", col_names = c("type", "calories", "sodium"))
```

    ## Rows: 54 Columns: 3
    ## ?????? Column specification ????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????
    ## Delimiter: "\t"
    ## chr (1): type
    ## dbl (2): calories, sodium
    ## 
    ## ??? Use `spec()` to retrieve the full column specification for this data.
    ## ??? Specify the column types or set `show_col_types = FALSE` to quiet this message.

``` r
# Display the summary of hotdogs
summary(hotdogs)
```

    ##      type              calories         sodium     
    ##  Length:54          Min.   : 86.0   Min.   :144.0  
    ##  Class :character   1st Qu.:132.0   1st Qu.:362.5  
    ##  Mode  :character   Median :145.0   Median :405.0  
    ##                     Mean   :145.4   Mean   :424.8  
    ##                     3rd Qu.:172.8   3rd Qu.:503.5  
    ##                     Max.   :195.0   Max.   :645.0

``` r
# The collectors you will need to import the data
fac <- col_factor(levels = c("Beef", "Meat", "Poultry"))
int <- col_integer()

# Edit the col_types argument to import the data correctly: hotdogs_factor
hotdogs_factor <- read_tsv("data/hotdogs.txt",
                           col_names = c("type", "calories", "sodium"),
                           col_types = list(fac, int, int))

# Display the summary of hotdogs_factor
summary(hotdogs_factor)
```

    ##       type       calories         sodium     
    ##  Beef   :20   Min.   : 86.0   Min.   :144.0  
    ##  Meat   :17   1st Qu.:132.0   1st Qu.:362.5  
    ##  Poultry:17   Median :145.0   Median :405.0  
    ##               Mean   :145.4   Mean   :424.8  
    ##               3rd Qu.:172.8   3rd Qu.:503.5  
    ##               Max.   :195.0   Max.   :645.0

Awesome! The summary of `hotdogs_factor` clearly contains more
interesting information for the `type` column, right?

## data.table: fread

Theory. Coming soon ???

**1. data.table: fread**

The other package I wanted to discuss is data-dot-table.

**2. data.table**

The key performance metric for the authors of data table, Matt Dowle and
Arun Srinivasan, is speed. The package is mainly about data manipulation
in R, but also features a super powerful function to read your data into
R: fread. If you have huge files you have to import and munge in R,
you???ll want to go with the data-dot-table package. Let???s start with
installing and loading the library:If you want to learn everything about
data-dot-table, DataCamp offers course material dedicated to this
package. In this course, we???ll stick to the fread function. It is pretty
similar to the ???read-dot-table??? function you???ve seen before but it is
more convenient to use. Let me introduce it with an example.

**3. fread()**

Suppose we have two versions of the states csv file, one with and one
without column names in the first row.

**4. fread()**

Let???s call fread on both these csv files, without additional arguments.
fread automatically deals with these two different cases. In the first
case, the column names are correctly transfered to the data frame, while
in the second case, fread made up some column names itself.

**5. fread()**

Next to automatically handling the names, fread can also infer the
column types and the field separators without having to specify these.
That???s the cool thing about fread: it just works. On top of that, it???s
ridiculously fast.Of course, the fread function does much more than
automatically finding out all column types and conventions in the files
you want to read. You can also manually specify the separator, the
colClasses, the number of lines to skip and the number of lines to read
in manually. Think of fread as an improved version of read-dot-table
which is faster, more convenient and adds functionality.

**6. Let???s practice!**

With these pointers on data-dot-table it???s time for you to get some
hands-on practice yourself. Enjoy!

## fread

You still remember how to use
<a href="http://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/utils/functions/read.table" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">`read.table()`</a>,
right? Well,
<a href="http://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/data.table/functions/fread" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">`fread()`</a>
is a function that does the same job with very similar arguments. It is
extremely easy to use and blazingly fast! Often, simply specifying the
path to the file is enough to successfully import your data.

Don???t take our word for it, try it yourself! You???ll be working with the
<a href="http://s3.amazonaws.com/assets.datacamp.com/production/course_1477/datasets/potatoes.csv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">`potatoes.csv`</a>
file, that???s available in your workspace. Fields are delimited by
commas, and the first line contains the column names.

**Steps**

1.  Use
    <a href="http://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/base/functions/library" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">`library()`</a>
    to load (NOT install) the `data.table` package. You **do not** need
    to install the package, it is already installed on DataCamp???s
    servers.
2.  Import `"potatoes.csv"` with
    <a href="http://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/data.table/functions/fread" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">`fread()`</a>.
    Simply pass it the file path and see if it worked. Store the result
    in a variable `potatoes`.
3.  Print out `potatoes`.

``` r

## fread: more advanced use

Now that you know the basics about
<a href="http://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/data.table/functions/fread" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">`fread()`</a>,
you should know about two arguments of the function: `drop` and
`select`, to drop or select variables of interest.

Suppose you have a dataset that contains 5 variables and you want to
keep the first and fifth variable, named ???a??? and ???e???. The following
options will all do the trick:

``` r
fread("path/to/file.txt", drop = 2:4)
fread("path/to/file.txt", select = c(1, 5))
fread("path/to/file.txt", drop = c("b", "c", "d"))
fread("path/to/file.txt", select = c("a", "e"))
```

Let???s stick with potatoes since we???re particularly fond of them here at
DataCamp. The data is again available in the file
<a href="http://s3.amazonaws.com/assets.datacamp.com/production/course_1477/datasets/potatoes.csv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">`potatoes.csv`</a>,
containing comma-separated records.

**Steps**

1.  Using
    <a href="http://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/data.table/functions/fread" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">`fread()`</a>
    and `select` or `drop` as arguments, only import the `texture` and
    `moistness` columns of the flat file. They correspond to the columns
    6 and 8 in `"potatoes.csv"`. Store the result in a variable
    `potatoes`.
2.  <a href="http://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/graphics/functions/plot" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">`plot()`</a>
    2 columns of the `potatoes` data frame: `texture` on the x-axis,
    `moistness` on the y-axis. Use the dollar sign notation twice. Feel
    free to name your axes and plot.

``` r
# Import columns 6 and 8 of potatoes.csv: potatoes
potatoes <- fread("data/potatoes.csv", select = c("texture", "moistness"))

# Plot texture (x) and moistness (y) of potatoes
plot(potatoes$texture, potatoes$moistness)
```

![](readme_files/figure-gfm/unnamed-chunk-19-1.png)<!-- -->

Congratulations! We can see that moistness and texture are positively
correlated.

## Dedicated classes

You might have noticed that the
<a href="http://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/data.table/functions/fread" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">`fread()`</a>
function produces data frames that look slightly different when you
print them out. That???s because another class named `data.table` is
assigned to the resulting data frames. The printout of such `data.table`
objects is different. Does something similar happen with the data frames
generated by `readr`?

In your current working directory, we prepared the
<a href="http://s3.amazonaws.com/assets.datacamp.com/production/course_1477/datasets/potatoes.csv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">`potatoes.csv`</a>
file. The packages `data.table` and `readr` are both loaded, so you can
experiment straight away.

Correct! What???s the benefit of these additional classes? Well, it allows
for a different treatment of printouts, for example. To learn all about
it, you can check out the DataCamp courses dedicated to dplyr and
data.table. For now, you can proceed to the next chapter in this course!

# 3. Importing Excel data

Excel is a widely used data analysis tool. If you prefer to do your
analyses in R, though, you???ll need an understanding of how to import
.csv data into R. This chapter will show you how to use readxl and gdata
to do so.

## readxl (1)

Theory. Coming soon ???

**1. readxl (1)**

Another tool that is extremely common in data analysis is

**2. Microsoft Excel**

Microsoft Excel. It shouldn???t be a surprise that there are a lot of
packages out there that interact with Excel so that you can work with
the data inside R. In this chapter, we???ll cover everything you need to
know to get started with excel files in R with practically no extra
work. In this video, I???ll be taking about Hadley Wickham???s readxl
package.

**3. Typical Structure Excel Data**

Before we dive into the R side of things, it???s a good idea to quickly
recap on what an excel file typically is. For most data related tasks,
an excel file contains different sheets that contain tabular data. Take
this excel file for example, cities-dot-xlsx, that contains two sheets
containing data of the total population of some capitals for two
different years.When you???re working in R, you???ll typically want to
explore your excel file first and then import some data from it. But how
do you go about this?

**4. readxl**

This is where the readxl package comes in. It basically contains two
main functions: excel_sheets and read_excel. The first one is used to
list the different sheets in your excel file, while the second one is
used to actually import a sheet into your R session. readxl is able to
handle both dot-xls as dot-xlsx files.So, let???s try it out! Let???s first
install and load the readxl package and then

**5. excel_sheets()**

start with the excel_sheets function. You simply pass it the file path,
which is the location of the dot-xls file on your own system. The file
is already in our working directory, as dir reveals, so we can simply
use the following call.The result is a simple character vector, that
contains the names of the different sheets. Indeed, you saw before that
the two sheets in the excel file are named year_1990 and year_2000.
Great.We already know about the sheet names now, but that???s just the
names, not the actual population data.

**6. read_excel()**

Fortunately, readxl also features the read_excel function to actually
import the sheet data into your R session.In its most basic use, you
simply specify the path to the excel file again.By default, the first
sheet, year_1990 in this case, is imported as a tibble. You can also
explicitly tell read_excel which sheet to import, by setting the sheet
argument. You can use both an index or the sheet name. Suppose you want
to load in the second sheet, named year_2000. The following two calls
both do that.In all of these read_excel calls, an R data frame results
that contains the Excel data. You can start your analyses right away!

**7. Let???s practice!**

Give it a first try in the exercises. In the next video, I???ll dive a
little deeper into the read_excel function!

## List the sheets of an Excel file

Before you can start importing from Excel, you should find out which
sheets are available in the workbook. You can use the
<a href="https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/readxl/readxl.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">`excel_sheets()`</a>
function for this.

You will find the Excel file
<a href="http://s3.amazonaws.com/assets.datacamp.com/production/course_1477/datasets/urbanpop.xlsx" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">`urbanpop.xlsx`</a>
in your working directory (type
<a href="http://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/base/functions/list.files" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">`dir()`</a>
to see it). This dataset contains urban population metrics for
practically all countries in the world throughout time (Source:
<a href="http://www.gapminder.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Gapminder</a>).
It contains three sheets for three different time periods. In each
sheet, the first row contains the column names.

**Steps**

1.  Load the `readxl` package using
    <a href="http://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/base/functions/library" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">`library()`</a>.
    It???s already installed on DataCamp???s servers.
2.  Use
    <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/readxl/readxl.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">`excel_sheets()`</a>
    to print out the names of the sheets in `urbanpop.xlsx`.

``` r
# Load the readxl package
library("readxl")

# Print the names of all worksheets
excel_sheets("data/urbanpop.xlsx")
```

    ## [1] "1960-1966" "1967-1974" "1975-2011"

Congratulations! As you can see, the result of
[`excel_sheets()`](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/readxl/readxl.pdf)
is simply a character vector; you haven???t imported anything yet. That???s
something for the
[`read_excel()`](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/readxl/readxl.pdf)
function. Learn all about it in the next exercise!

## Import an Excel sheet

Now that you know the names of the sheets in the Excel file you want to
import, it is time to import those sheets into R. You can do this with
the
<a href="https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/readxl/readxl.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">`read_excel()`</a>
function. Have a look at this recipe:

``` r
data <- read_excel("data.xlsx", sheet = "my_sheet")
```

This call simply imports the sheet with the name `"my_sheet"` from the
`"data.xlsx"` file. You can also pass a number to the `sheet` argument;
this will cause
<a href="https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/readxl/readxl.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">`read_excel()`</a>
to import the sheet with the given sheet number. `sheet = 1` will import
the first sheet, `sheet = 2` will import the second sheet, and so on.

In this exercise, you???ll continue working with the
<a href="http://s3.amazonaws.com/assets.datacamp.com/production/course_1477/datasets/urbanpop.xlsx" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">`urbanpop.xlsx`</a>
file.

**Steps**

1.  The code to import the first and second sheets is already included.
    Can you add a command to also import the third sheet, and store the
    resulting data frame in `pop_3`?
2.  Store the data frames `pop_1`, `pop_2` and `pop_3` in a list, that
    you call `pop_list`.
3.  Display the structure of `pop_list`.

``` r
# Read the sheets, one by one
pop_1 <- read_excel("data/urbanpop.xlsx", sheet = 1)
pop_2 <- read_excel("data/urbanpop.xlsx", sheet = 2)
pop_3 <- read_excel("data/urbanpop.xlsx", sheet = 3)

# Put pop_1, pop_2 and pop_3 in a list: pop_list
pop_list <- list(pop_1, pop_2, pop_3)

# Display the structure of pop_list
str(pop_list)
```

Great! Now you imported the sheets from `urbanpop.xlsx` correctly. From
here on you are able to read and to operate on the imported file. In the
next exercise you will learn how to use both the
[`excel_sheets()`](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/readxl/readxl.pdf)
and the
[`read_excel()`](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/readxl/readxl.pdf)
function in combination with
[`lapply()`](http://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/base/functions/lapply)
to read multiple sheets at once.

## Reading a workbook

In the previous exercise you generated a list of three Excel sheets that
you imported. However, loading in every sheet manually and then merging
them in a list can be quite tedious. Luckily, you can automate this with
<a href="http://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/base/functions/lapply" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">`lapply()`</a>.
If you have no experience with

feel free to take
<a href="https://campus.datacamp.com/courses/intermediate-r/chapter-4-the-apply-family?ex=1" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Chapter
4 of the Intermediate R course</a>.

Have a look at the example code below:

``` r
my_workbook <- lapply(excel_sheets("data.xlsx"),
                      read_excel,
                      path = "data.xlsx")
```

The
<a href="https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/readxl/readxl.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">`read_excel()`</a>
function is called multiple times on the `"data.xlsx"` file and each
sheet is loaded in one after the other. The result is a list of data
frames, each data frame representing one of the sheets in `data.xlsx`.

You???re still working with the
<a href="http://s3.amazonaws.com/assets.datacamp.com/production/course_1477/datasets/urbanpop.xlsx" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">`urbanpop.xlsx`</a>
file.

**Steps**

1.  Use
    <a href="http://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/base/functions/lapply" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">`lapply()`</a>
    in combination with
    <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/readxl/readxl.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">`excel_sheets()`</a>
    and
    <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/readxl/readxl.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">`read_excel()`</a>
    to read all the Excel sheets in `"urbanpop.xlsx"`. Name the
    resulting list `pop_list`.
2.  Print the structure of `pop_list`.

``` r
# Read all Excel sheets with lapply(): pop_list
pop_list <- lapply(excel_sheets("data/urbanpop.xlsx"), read_excel, path = "data/urbanpop.xlsx")

# Display the structure of pop_list
str(pop_list)
```

Congratulations! If you???re clever, reading multiple Excel sheets doesn???t
require a lot of coding at all!

## readxl (2)

Theory. Coming soon ???

**1. readxl (2)**

Next to the path and sheet arguments that we discussed in the previous
video,

**2. read_excel()**

there are also other arguments you can specify. Have a look at the usage
of the read_excel function as it appears in the documentation; can you
tell the meaning of these arguments? path and sheets have no secrets for
you anymore.

**3. read_excel() - col_names**

Then, there???s col_names, which can be three things: TRUE, the default,
which means what the first row of the Excel sheet contains the column
names. It can also be FALSE, in which case R comes up with its own
names. Finally, you can also set it a character vector specifying the
column names. Excel can contain different data types, such as text,
numerics and dates. How this converts to R classes is controlled in the
col_types argument:

**4. read_excel() - col_types**

By default it is NULL, which has R guess the data types of the different
columns. But you can also manually specify the col_types. Suppose you
want to import all the columns of the first sheet as text. This command
will do the trick: The column classes we can see in the printout reveal
that indeed, the pop_data variable contains two columns that two are
character now, perfect. Other keywords to enforce a type are ???numeric???,
???date??? and ???blank???. ???numeric??? and ???date??? are straightforward, but what
about ???blank????

**5. read_excel() - col_types**

Well, if you use blank, you???re simply ignoring that column. If we adapt
the previous call like this: You???ll see that the population column is
missing. This ???blank??? keyword can come in handy when you have an Excel
file with a lot of columns and you only need some of them in R.

**6. read_excel() - skip**

Next, there???s the skip argument. It specifies the number of rows in your
excel sheet R has to skip before actually importing the data. Let???s say
the first two rows in the first sheet of cities-dot-xlsx are not
necessary for our analysis. To ignore them, we can simply set the skip
argument to 2 and read_excel will not import these lines. we???ll also
have to set the col_names argument, because the first row with the
column names is skipped as well. if we try out this code, indeed 2 rows
were skipped: the row containing the column names and the first
observations. That leaves us with the last three observations. In readr,
there was also the n_max argument, to specify the number of records to
read. Currently this functionality is not available in readxl, but this
might be added in the future. The package is still under development as
we speak.

**7. Wrap-up**

Actually, the excel_sheets and read_excel are the only functions that
are available in the readxl package. These two functions and the
customization possibilities are all you need to get started with your
excel data in R. On top of all that, readxl is extremely fast. You might
have recognized many of the arguments of the readr package of the
previous chapter. Hadley Wickham made reading data from different data
sources pretty consistent. This can only make your job of importing data
easier, right?

## The col_names argument

Apart from `path` and `sheet`, there are several other arguments you can
specify in
<a href="https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/readxl/readxl.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">`read_excel()`</a>.
One of these arguments is called `col_names`.

By default it is `TRUE`, denoting whether the first row in the Excel
sheets contains the column names. If this is not the case, you can set
`col_names` to `FALSE`. In this case, R will choose column names for
you. You can also choose to set `col_names` to a character vector with
names for each column. It works exactly the same as in the `readr`
package.

You???ll be working with the
<a href="http://s3.amazonaws.com/assets.datacamp.com/production/course_1477/datasets/urbanpop_nonames.xlsx" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">`urbanpop_nonames.xlsx`</a>
file. It contains the same data as
<a href="http://s3.amazonaws.com/assets.datacamp.com/production/course_1477/datasets/urbanpop.xlsx" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">`urbanpop.xlsx`</a>
but has no column names in the first row of the excel sheets.

**Steps**

1.  Import the *first* Excel sheet of `"urbanpop_nonames.xlsx"` and
    store the result in `pop_a`. Have R set the column names of the
    resulting data frame itself.
2.  Import the first Excel sheet of `urbanpop_nonames.xlsx`; this time,
    use the `cols` vector that has already been prepared for you to
    specify the column names. Store the resulting data frame in `pop_b`.
3.  Print out the summary of `pop_a`.
4.  Print out the summary of `pop_b`. Can you spot the difference with
    the other summary?

``` r
# Import the first Excel sheet of urbanpop_nonames.xlsx (R gives names): pop_a
pop_a <- read_excel("data/urbanpop_nonames.xlsx", col_names = F)
```

    ## New names:
    ## * `` -> ...1
    ## * `` -> ...2
    ## * `` -> ...3
    ## * `` -> ...4
    ## * `` -> ...5
    ## * ...

``` r
# Import the first Excel sheet of urbanpop_nonames.xlsx (specify col_names): pop_b
cols <- c("country", paste0("year_", 1960:1966))
pop_b <- read_excel("data/urbanpop_nonames.xlsx", col_names = cols)

# Print the summary of pop_a
summary(pop_a)
```

Well done! Did you spot the difference between the summaries? It???s
really crucial to correctly tell R whether your Excel data contains
column names. If you don???t, the head of the data frame you end up with
will contain incorrect information???

## The skip argument

Another argument that can be very useful when reading in Excel files
that are less tidy, is `skip`. With `skip`, you can tell R to ignore a
specified number of rows inside the Excel sheets you???re trying to pull
data from. Have a look at this example:

``` r
read_excel("data.xlsx", skip = 15)
```

In this case, the first 15 rows in the first sheet of `"data.xlsx"` are
ignored.

If the first row of this sheet contained the column names, this
information will also be ignored by `readxl`. Make sure to set
`col_names` to `FALSE` or manually specify column names in this case!

The file
<a href="http://s3.amazonaws.com/assets.datacamp.com/production/course_1477/datasets/urbanpop.xlsx" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">`urbanpop.xlsx`</a>
is available in your directory; it has column names in the first rows.

**Steps**

1.  Import the *second* sheet of `"urbanpop.xlsx"`, but skip the first
    21 rows. Make sure to set `col_names = FALSE`. Store the resulting
    data frame in a variable `urbanpop_sel`.
2.  Select the first observation from `urbanpop_sel` and print it out.

``` r
# Import the second sheet of urbanpop.xlsx, skipping the first 21 rows: urbanpop_sel
urbanpop_sel <- read_excel("data/urbanpop.xlsx", sheet = 2, col_names = F, skip = 21)
```

    ## New names:
    ## * `` -> ...1
    ## * `` -> ...2
    ## * `` -> ...3
    ## * `` -> ...4
    ## * `` -> ...5
    ## * ...

``` r
# Print out the first observation from urbanpop_sel
urbanpop_sel[1,]
```

    ## # A tibble: 1 ?? 9
    ##   ...1     ...2    ...3    ...4    ...5    ...6    ...7    ...8    ...9
    ##   <chr>   <dbl>   <dbl>   <dbl>   <dbl>   <dbl>   <dbl>   <dbl>   <dbl>
    ## 1 Benin 382022. 411859. 443013. 475611. 515820. 557938. 602093. 648410.

Nice job! This is about as complicated as the
[`read_excel()`](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/readxl/readxl.pdf)
call can get! Time to learn about another package to import data from
Excel: gdata.

## gdata

Theory. Coming soon ???

**1. gdata**

Before, I introduced the readxl package, which is a very efficient
package to import data from excel to R. But there are of course
alternatives to readxl. In this video, I???ll be discussing one of those
alternatives:

**2. gdata**

the gdata package, currently maintained by Gregory Warnes.Actually, the
gdata package is an entire suite of tools for performing data
manipulation in all sorts of fields. It kind of supercharges your basic
R distribution to make handling your data less painful. Among these
tools, there is also a function that allows you to import Excel data:
read dot xls. Out of the box, gdata can only handle the xls format, but
you can easily install a driver to support the newer xlsx format as
well. There???s no function to list the different sheets in an excel file,
like excel_sheets in readxl.

**3. gdata**

To import data from Excel, gdata uses Perl, another interpreted
programming language. The Perl code converts the data in the excel sheet
to a csv file.

**4. gdata**

Next, this csv file is read into R using the default read-dot-csv
function from the utils package.

**5. gdata**

read-dot-csv itself is a wrapper around read-dot-table, remember?

**6. gdata**

This function can be customized in millions of ways; there are more than
15 arguments you can specify. All these read-dot-table arguments are
also available for gdata read-dot-xls function. In this respect, the
read-dot-xls function is an extension of the data input functions from
the utils package to Excel files. This makes it easy to use for people
who are familiar with the import functions of the utils package and
their arguments.On the other hand, first converting an entire xls file
to a csv file, to next import it into R with the slow read dot csv
function is extremely inefficient. What if you???re dealing with huge
Excel files? You???d have to convert the entire file, and then read it.
That???s quite some extra work you???re doing. Wickham???s readxl package is
way faster here.So why use gdata in the first place then? Well, we
believe that readxl will become the standard package to import Excel
data. However, as we speak, the readxl package is still under
development: the version we???re working with is pre-V1. If you don???t want
to rely on packages that are still under heavy development and whose
syntax can still change, you can stick to more established packages like
gdata.Now, let???s get practical. Still remember the cities dot xlsx file?

**7. cities.xls**

Here it is as a xls file this time, cities dot xls. Two sheets,
containing the population of some capitals in 1990 and 2000.

**8. read.xls()**

Let???s first install and load gdata, and then try gdata???s read-dot-xls
function to import the excel data.As before, the first argument you pass
it is the path to the file; in our case, cities-dot-xls is still in the
working directory. If your Excel file contains multiple sheets, only the
first sheet is imported. You can again choose to specify a different
sheet by sheet number or by sheet name, like this example.

## Import a local file

In this part of the chapter you???ll learn how to import `.xls` files
using the `gdata` package. Similar to the `readxl` package, you can
import single Excel sheets from Excel sheets to start your analysis in
R.

You???ll be working with the
<a href="http://s3.amazonaws.com/assets.datacamp.com/production/course_1477/datasets/urbanpop.xls" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">`urbanpop.xls`</a>
dataset, the `.xls` version of the Excel file you???ve been working with
before. It???s available in your current working directory.

**Steps**

1.  Load the `gdata` package with
    <a href="http://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/base/functions/library" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">`library()`</a>.
    `gdata` and Perl are already installed on DataCamp???s Servers.
2.  Import the second sheet, named `"1967-1974"`, of `"urbanpop.xls"`
    with
    <a href="http://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/gdata/functions/read.xls" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">`read.xls()`</a>.
    Store the resulting data frame as `urban_pop`.
3.  Print the first 11 observations of `urban_pop` with
    <a href="http://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/utils/functions/head" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">`head()`</a>.

``` r
# Load the gdata package

Congratulations! There seems to be a lot of missing data, but
[`read.xls()`](http://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/gdata/functions/read.xls)
knows how to handle it. In the next exercise you will learn which
arguments you can use in `read.xls()`.

## read.xls() wraps around read.table()

Remember how
<a href="http://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/gdata/functions/read.xls" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">`read.xls()`</a>
actually works? It basically comes down to two steps: converting the
Excel file to a `.csv` file using a Perl script, and then reading that
`.csv` file with the
<a href="http://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/utils/functions/read.table" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">`read.csv()`</a>
function that is loaded by default in R, through the `utils` package.

This means that all the options that you can specify in
<a href="http://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/utils/functions/read.table" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">`read.csv()`</a>,
can also be specified in
<a href="http://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/gdata/functions/read.xls" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">`read.xls()`</a>.

The
<a href="http://s3.amazonaws.com/assets.datacamp.com/production/course_1477/datasets/urbanpop.xls" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">`urbanpop.xls`</a>
dataset is already available in your workspace. It???s still comprised of
three sheets, and has column names in the first row of each sheet.

**Steps**

1.  Finish the `read.xls()` call that reads data from the second sheet
    of `urbanpop.xls`: skip the first 50 rows of the sheet. Make sure to
    set `header` appropriately and that the country names are not
    imported as factors.
2.  Print the first 10 observations of `urban_pop` with `head()`.

``` r
# Column names for urban_pop
columns <- c("country", paste0("year_", 1967:1974))

# Finish the read.xls call
urban_pop <- read.xls("data/urbanpop.xls", sheet = 2,
                      skip = 50, header = F, stringsAsFactors = F,
                      col.names = columns)

# Print first 10 observation of urban_pop
head(urban_pop, n = 10)
```

## Work that Excel data!

Now that you can read in Excel data, let???s try to clean and merge it.
You already used the
<a href="http://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/base/functions/cbind" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">`cbind()`</a>
function some exercises ago. Let???s take it one step further now.

The
<a href="http://s3.amazonaws.com/assets.datacamp.com/production/course_1477/datasets/urbanpop.xls" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">`urbanpop.xls`</a>
dataset is available in your working directory. The file still contains
three sheets, and has column names in the first row of each sheet.

**Steps**

1.  Add code to read the data from the third sheet in `"urbanpop.xls"`.
    You want to end up with three data frames: `urban_sheet1`,
    `urban_sheet2` and `urban_sheet3`.
2.  Extend the `cbind()` call so that it also includes `urban_sheet3`.
    Make sure the first column of `urban_sheet2` and `urban_sheet3` are
    removed, so you don???t have duplicate columns. Store the result in
    `urban`.
3.  Use
    <a href="http://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/stats/functions/na.fail" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">`na.omit()`</a>
    on the `urban` data frame to remove all rows that contain `NA`
    values. Store the cleaned data frame as `urban_clean`.
4.  Print a summary of `urban_clean` and assert that there are no more
    `NA` values.

``` r
# Add code to import data from all three sheets in urbanpop.xls
path <- "data/urbanpop.xls"
urban_sheet1 <- read.xls(path, sheet = 1, stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
urban_sheet2 <- read.xls(path, sheet = 2, stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
urban_sheet3 <- read.xls(path, sheet = 3, stringsAsFactors = FALSE)

# Extend the cbind() call to include urban_sheet3: urban
urban <- cbind(urban_sheet1, urban_sheet2[-1], urban_sheet3[-1])

# Remove all rows with NAs from urban: urban_clean
urban_clean <- na.omit(urban)

# Print out a summary of urban_clean
summary(urban_clean)
```

Awesome! Time for something totally different: `XLConnect`.

# 4. Reproducible Excel work with XLConnect

Beyond importing data from Excel, you can take things one step further
with XLConnect. Learn all about it and bridge the gap between R and
Excel.

## Reading sheets

Theory. Coming soon ???

**1. Reading sheets**

You already got to know two very useful packages to work with Excel
data - the readxl package and the gdata package. Now imagine this
situation.

**2. Insert title here???**

You???re working in a big company that uses Excel for all there analysis
work. You are forced to work on and deliver these Excel files, but you
want to work on the data through R, so that you can modify the files in
a reproducible way? I???m happy to tell you that there is a package that
does just that:

**3. XLConnect**

XLConnect, written and maintained by Martin Studer. He created one of
the most comprehensive packages for working with Excel files through
R.You can think of XLConnect as a bridge between Excel and R. That means
you can do practically any action you could do within Excel but you do
it from inside R. Editing Excel sheets, formatting data and adapting
entire calculation sheets, you name it. XLConnect has a function for it.
XLConnect works with xls and xlsx files, and has easy-to-use
functions.To get this all working so smoothly, XLConnect depends on
Java. This is totally abstracted away for us end-users, but installing
the package can have its difficulties.

**4. Installation**

If you???re starting from a reasonably clean computing environment, this
traditional install-dot-packages command will work fine. From the
messaging, you???ll see that it also installs the XLConnectJars package
containing Java files and class definitions that XLConnect depends on.
If it wasn???t installed already, the rJava package will also be
installed, providing a low-level R to Java interface that XLConnect
uses.If something goes wrong during installation, it???s possible that you
first have to install the Java Development Kit, or JDK, from Oracle???s
web site. If things still don???t work out, I suggest you google the
errors you???re getting: there???s quite some people using this package so
help is never far away.With our package installed and not to forget,
loaded,

**5. loadWorkbook()**

let???s take the first step: loading a workbook into R. You do this with
the loadWorkbook function, by simply passing the name of the excel file
you want to interface to. Assuming that our cities-dot-xlsx file is
still in the current working directory, this call works.If you have a
look at the structure of book, we see that it is a so-called workbook
object. This object is the actual ???bridge??? between R and Excel I talked
about earlier.After building a workbook object in R, you can use it to
get information on the Excel file it links to. To get the names of the
different sheets,

**6. getSheets()**

for example, you can use getSheets.The result is exactly the same to the
excel_sheets function from readxl: a character vector containing the two
sheet names.Apart from sheet information,

**7. readWorksheet()**

you can also read the actual data from the sheets, like readxl???s
read_excel function and gdata???s read dot xls function. Suppose we want
to import the data from the year_2000 sheet as a data frame. As the
first argument to readWorksheet, we pass the workbook object, book in
our case. The second argument, sheet, is the name or index of the sheet
you want to import from.Works just like before. The cool thing here is,
that you can easily specify from which row and which column to start
reading information.

**8. readWorksheet()**

Say you only want the population information for Berlin and Madrid. You
can simply set startRow to 3, endRow to 4 and startCol to 2. Because you
skipped the first row, the column names are also skipped, so you should
set header to FALSE.

## Connect to a workbook

When working with `XLConnect`, the first step will be to load a workbook
in your R session with
<a href="http://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/XLConnect/functions/loadWorkbook" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">`loadWorkbook()`</a>;
this function will build a ???bridge??? between your Excel file and your R
session.

In this and the following exercises, you will continue to work with
<a href="http://s3.amazonaws.com/assets.datacamp.com/production/course_1477/datasets/urbanpop.xlsx" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">`urbanpop.xlsx`</a>,
containing urban population data throughout time. The Excel file is
available in your current working directory.

**Steps**

1.  Load the `XLConnect` package using
    <a href="http://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/base/functions/library" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">`library()`</a>;
    it is already installed on DataCamp???s servers.
2.  Use
    <a href="http://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/XLConnect/functions/loadWorkbook" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">`loadWorkbook()`</a>
    to build a connection to the `"urbanpop.xlsx"` file in R. Call the
    workbook `my_book`.
3.  Print out the class of `my_book`. What does this tell you?

``` r
# Load the XLConnect package
library("XLConnect")
```

    ## XLConnect 1.0.5 by Mirai Solutions GmbH [aut],
    ##   Martin Studer [cre],
    ##   The Apache Software Foundation [ctb, cph] (Apache POI),
    ##   Graph Builder [ctb, cph] (Curvesapi Java library),
    ##   Brett Woolridge [ctb, cph] (SparseBitSet Java library)

    ## https://mirai-solutions.ch
    ## https://github.com/miraisolutions/xlconnect

``` r
# Build connection to urbanpop.xlsx: my_book
my_book <- loadWorkbook("data/urbanpop.xlsx")

# Print out the class of my_book
class(my_book)
```

    ## [1] "workbook"
    ## attr(,"package")
    ## [1] "XLConnect"

## List and read Excel sheets

Just as `readxl` and `gdata`, you can use `XLConnect` to import data
from Excel file into R.

To list the sheets in an Excel file, use
<a href="http://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/XLConnect/functions/getSheets-methods" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">`getSheets()`</a>.
To actually import data from a sheet, you can use
<a href="http://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/XLConnect/functions/readWorksheet-methods" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">`readWorksheet()`</a>.
Both functions require an XLConnect workbook object as the first
argument.

You???ll again be working with
<a href="http://s3.amazonaws.com/assets.datacamp.com/production/course_1477/datasets/urbanpop.xlsx" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">`urbanpop.xlsx`</a>.
The `my_book` object that links to this Excel file has already been
created.

**Steps**

1.  Print out the sheets of the Excel file that `my_book` links to.
2.  Import the second sheet in `my_book` as a data frame. Print it out.

``` r
# Build connection to urbanpop.xlsx
my_book <- loadWorkbook("data/urbanpop.xlsx")

# List the sheets in my_book
getSheets(my_book)
```

    ## [1] "1960-1966" "1967-1974" "1975-2011"

``` r
# Import the second sheet in my_book
readWorksheet(my_book, "1967-1974")
```

## Customize readWorksheet

To get a clear overview about
<a href="http://s3.amazonaws.com/assets.datacamp.com/production/course_1477/datasets/urbanpop.xlsx" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">`urbanpop.xlsx`</a>
without having to open up the Excel file, you can execute the following
code:

``` r
my_book <- loadWorkbook("urbanpop.xlsx")
sheets <- getSheets(my_book)
all <- lapply(sheets, readWorksheet, object = my_book)
str(all)
```

Suppose we???re only interested in urban population data of the years
1968, 1969 and 1970. The data for these years is in the columns 3, 4,
and 5 of the second sheet. Only selecting these columns will leave us in
the dark about the actual countries the figures belong to.

**Steps**

1.  Extend the `readWorksheet()` command with the `startCol` and
    `endCol` arguments to only import the columns 3, 4, and 5 of the
    second sheet.
2.  `urbanpop_sel` no longer contains information about the countries
    now. Can you write another `readWorksheet()` command that imports
    only the first column from the second sheet? Store the resulting
    data frame as `countries`.
3.  Use `cbind()` to paste together `countries` and `urbanpop_sel`, in
    this order. Store the result as `selection`.

``` r
# Build connection to urbanpop.xlsx
my_book <- loadWorkbook("data/urbanpop.xlsx")

# Import columns 3, 4, and 5 from second sheet in my_book: urbanpop_sel
urbanpop_sel <- readWorksheet(my_book, sheet = 2, startCol = 3, endCol = 5)

# Import first column from second sheet in my_book: countries
countries <- readWorksheet(my_book, sheet = 2, startCol = 1, endCol = 1)

# cbind() urbanpop_sel and countries together: selection
selection <- cbind(countries, urbanpop_sel)
```

## Adapting sheets

Theory. Coming soon ???

**1. Adapting sheets**

Up to now, XLConnect isn???t blowing your mind, is it? Just listing sheets
and importing data from them into R is nothing new. But XLConnect has
more to offer than just importing excel data into R. This package is an
easy tool to modify the content of your workbook comfortably through R.

**2. New data!**

Say you managed to lay your hands om some fresh population data from
2010, that is stored in a data frame, pop_2010.

**3. createSheet()**

To store this info a new sheet, we start with loading XLConnect, and
making a connection to the workbook. After that, we can use createSheet,
and pass the workbook and the name of the new sheet, like this.

**4. createSheet()**

Now we can actually populate our new sheet with the data, for which
we???ll use

**5. writeWorksheet()**

writeWorksheet. The first argument, as always, is the workbook, followed
by the data we want to add, so pop_2010 and finally the sheet we want to
add it to. Let???s use the sheet name that was specified in createSheet,
but the number of the sheet, 3, would work fine as well.If you open the
excel file, though, you won???t see the new sheet. You???ll have to
explicitly save the entire workbook to a file for the changes to take
effect.

**6. saveWorkbook()**

You do this with saveWorkbook, like this.

**7. saveWorkbook()**

I suggest you specify a new filename, cities2.xlsx for example, so you
don???t overwrite the file you started with.If you now check out the new
Excel file, you see that the additional data is in there.
Awesome!Suppose that after creating this additional worksheet, you don???t
feel comfortable with the name you chose. In fact, you want to rename
all sheets. Piece of cake:

**8. renameSheet()**

just use the renameSheet function. As uaual, the first argument is the
workbook, and then you pass the old name and the new name. We???ll use
this command three times, the change year with y for the three different
sheets.

**9. renameSheet()**

Finally, we save the result again to a new file with saveWorksheet:
cities3.xlsx.A quick peek at the new Excel file reveals that we
successfully renamed the sheets. Perfect.

**10. removeSheet()**

Another Excel job would be to remove a sheet altogether. To remove the
third sheet here, for example, simply use removeSheet with the workbook
and the sheet name or sheet number as arguments.

**11. removeSheet()**

If you save the workbook to a file again and open up the file, our third
sheet is gone.

**12. Wrap-up**

Of course these are pretty basic operations, that you can easily do in
Excel as well, but the cool thing is that you can program all of these
tasks in R in a reproducible way. If you update the commands that we???ve
used here, and run them all again, one after the other, it should all
still work fine.Apart from the functions I discussed here, there are
also methods to style cells, getting, setting and recalculate formulas,
merging and splitting up cells, the whole shebang. But let???s not dive
into those here and start small.

## Add worksheet

Where `readxl` and `gdata` were only able to import Excel data,
`XLConnect`???s approach of providing an actual interface to an Excel file
makes it able to edit your Excel files from inside R. In this exercise,
you???ll create a new sheet. In the next exercise, you???ll populate the
sheet with data, and save the results in a new Excel file.

You???ll continue to work with
<a href="http://s3.amazonaws.com/assets.datacamp.com/production/course_1477/datasets/urbanpop.xlsx" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">`urbanpop.xlsx`</a>.
The `my_book` object that links to this Excel file is already available.

**Steps**

1.  Use
    <a href="http://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/XLConnect/functions/createSheet-methods" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">`createSheet()`</a>,
    to create a new sheet in `my_book`, named `"data_summary"`.
2.  Use
    <a href="https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/XLConnect/topics/getSheets-methods" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">`getSheets()`</a>
    to verify that `my_book` now represents an Excel file with four
    sheets.

``` r
# Build connection to urbanpop.xlsx
my_book <- loadWorkbook("data/urbanpop.xlsx")

# Add a worksheet to my_book, named "data_summary"
createSheet(my_book, "data_summary")

# Use getSheets() on my_book
getSheets(my_book)
```

    ## [1] "1960-1966"    "1967-1974"    "1975-2011"    "data_summary"

Great! It???s time to populate your newly created worksheet!

## Populate worksheet

The first step of creating a sheet is done; let???s populate it with some
data now! `summ`, a data frame with some summary statistics on the two
Excel sheets is already coded so you can take it from there.

**Steps**

1.  Use
    <a href="http://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/XLConnect/functions/writeWorksheet-methods" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">`writeWorksheet()`</a>
    to populate the `"data_summary"` sheet with the `summ` data frame.
2.  Call
    <a href="http://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/XLConnect/functions/saveWorkbook-methods" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">`saveWorkbook()`</a>
    to store the adapted Excel workbook as a new file, `"summary.xlsx"`.

``` r
# Build connection to urbanpop.xlsx
my_book <- loadWorkbook("data/urbanpop.xlsx")

# Add a worksheet to my_book, named "data_summary"
createSheet(my_book, "data_summary")

# Create data frame: summ
sheets <- getSheets(my_book)[1:3]
dims <- sapply(sheets, function(x) dim(readWorksheet(my_book, sheet = x)), USE.NAMES = FALSE)
summ <- data.frame(sheets = sheets,
                   nrows = dims[1, ],
                   ncols = dims[2, ])

# Add data in summ to "data_summary" sheet
writeWorksheet(my_book, data = summ, sheet = "data_summary")

# Save workbook as summary.xlsx
saveWorkbook(my_book, "data/summary.xlsx")
```

Great! If you took the correct steps, the resulting Excel file looks
like [this
file](https://s3.amazonaws.com/assets.datacamp.com/production/course_1477/datasets/summary.xlsx).

## Renaming sheets

Come to think of it, `"data_summary"` is not an ideal name. As the
summary of these excel sheets is always data-related, you simply want to
name the sheet `"summary"`.

The code to build a connection to `"urbanpop.xlsx"` and create `my_book`
is already provided for you. It refers to an Excel file with 4 sheets:
the three data sheets, and the `"data_summary"` sheet.

**Steps**

1.  Use `renameSheet()` to rename the fourth sheet to `"summary"`.
2.  Next, call `getSheets()` on `my_book` to print out the sheet names.
3.  Finally, make sure to actually save the `my_book` object to a new
    Excel file, `"renamed.xlsx"`.

``` r
# Rename "data_summary" sheet to "summary"
renameSheet(my_book, "data_summary", "summary")

# Print out sheets of my_book
getSheets(my_book)
```

    ## [1] "1960-1966" "1967-1974" "1975-2011" "summary"

``` r
# Save workbook to "renamed.xlsx"
saveWorkbook(my_book, "data/renamed.xlsx")
```

Nice one! You can find the file you just created
[here](https://s3.amazonaws.com/assets.datacamp.com/production/course_1477/datasets/renamed.xlsx).

## Removing sheets

After presenting the new Excel sheet to your peers, it appears not
everybody is a big fan. Why summarize sheets and store the info in Excel
if all the information is implicitly available? To hell with it, just
remove the entire fourth sheet!

**Steps**

1.  Load the `XLConnect` package.
2.  Build a connection to `"renamed.xlsx"`, the Excel file that you???ve
    built in the previous exercise; it???s available in your working
    directory. Store this connection as `my_book`.
3.  Use `removeSheet()` to remove the fourth sheet from `my_book`. The
    sheet name is `"summary"`. Recall that `removeSheet()` accepts
    either the index or the name of the sheet as the second argument.
4.  Save the resulting workbook, `my_book`, to a file `"clean.xlsx"`.

``` r
# Load the XLConnect package
library("XLConnect")

# Build connection to renamed.xlsx: my_book
my_book <- loadWorkbook("data/renamed.xlsx")

# Remove the fourth sheet
removeSheet(my_book, 4)

# Save workbook to "clean.xlsx"
saveWorkbook(my_book, "data/clean.xlsx")
```

Nice one! The file you???ve created in this exercise is available
[here](https://s3.amazonaws.com/assets.datacamp.com/production/course_1477/datasets/clean.xlsx).

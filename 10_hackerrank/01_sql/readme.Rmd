```

## Revising the Select Query II

Query the NAME field for all American cities in the CITY table with populations larger than 120000. The CountryCode for America is USA.

```{sql}
SELECT NAME
FROM CITY1
WHERE POPULATION > 120000
AND COUNTRYCODE = "USA";
```

## Select All

Query all columns (attributes) for every row in the CITY table.

```{sql}
SELECT *
FROM city1;
```

## Select BY ID

```

## Japanese Cities' Attributes

Query all attributes of every Japanese city in the CITY table. The COUNTRYCODE for Japan is JPN.

```{sql}

```{sql}
SELECT CITY, STATE 
FROM STATION;
```

## Weather Observation Station 2

## Weather Observation Station 3

*MODULO*

**Note** 
You can write two separate queries to get the desired output. It need not be a single query.

```

# Advanced Select

**easy**

## Triangles data

```{sql}
select column_name, column_type 
from INFORMATION_SCHEMA.COLUMNS 
where TABLE_NAME='TRIANGLES';
```

## Type of Triangle

Write a query identifying the type of each record in the TRIANGLES table using its three side lengths. Output one of the following statements for each record in the table:

* Equilateral: It's a triangle with  sides of equal length.
* Isosceles: It's a triangle with  sides of equal length.
* Scalene: It's a triangle with  sides of differing lengths.
* Not A Triangle: The given values of A, B, and C don't form a triangle.

```{sql}
SELECT CASE             
            WHEN A + B > C AND B + C > A AND A + C > B THEN
                CASE 
                    WHEN A = B AND B = C THEN 'Equilateral'
                    WHEN A = B OR B = C OR A = C THEN 'Isosceles'
                    ELSE 'Scalene'
                END
            ELSE 'Not A Triangle'
        END
FROM TRIANGLES;
```

Explanation
Values in the tuple (20,20,23) form an Isosceles triangle, because A = B. 
Values in the tuple (20,20,20) form an Equilateral triangle, because A = B = C.
Values in the tuple (20,21,22) form a Scalene triangle, because A != B != C. 
Values in the tuple (13,14,30) cannot form a triangle because the combined value of sides A and B is not larger than that of side C.

## THE PADS

Generate the following two result sets:

1. Query an alphabetically ordered list of all names in OCCUPATIONS, immediately followed by the first letter of each profession as a parenthetical (i.e.: enclosed in parentheses). For example: AnActorName(A), ADoctorName(D), AProfessorName(P), and ASingerName(S).
2. Query the number of ocurrences of each occupation in OCCUPATIONS. Sort the occurrences in ascending order, and output them in the following format: 

```{sql}
select concat(Name,'(',Substring(Occupation,1,1),')') as Name
from occupations
order by Name;
```

```{sql}
select concat('There are a total of',' ',count(occupation),' ',lower(occupation),'s.') as total
from occupations
group by occupation
order by total;
```

## Occupations

Pivot the Occupation column in OCCUPATIONS so that each Name is sorted alphabetically and displayed underneath its corresponding Occupation. The output column headers should be Doctor, Professor, Singer, and Actor, respectively.

Note: Print NULL when there are no more names corresponding to an occupation. 

Step 1: Create a virtual table in your head of the data given to us.

```{sql}
SELECT
    case when Occupation='Doctor' then Name end as Doctor,
    case when Occupation='Professor' then Name end as Professor,
    case when Occupation='Singer' then Name end as Singer,
    case when Occupation='Actor' then Name end as Actor
FROM OCCUPATIONS
```

Step 2: Create an index column with respect to occupation as "RowNumber"

```{sql}
set @r1=0, @r2=0, @r3=0, @r4=0;
```

```{sql}
SELECT case 
	when Occupation='Doctor' then (@r1:=@r1+1)
        when Occupation='Professor' then (@r2:=@r2+1)
        when Occupation='Singer' then (@r3:=@r3+1)
        when Occupation='Actor' then (@r4:=@r4+1) end as RowNumber

FROM OCCUPATIONS
```

Step 3: Combine the result from step 1 and step 2:

```{sql}
set @r1=0, @r2=0, @r3=0, @r4=0;
```

```{sql}
SELECT case 
	when Occupation='Doctor' then (@r1:=@r1+1)
        when Occupation='Professor' then (@r2:=@r2+1)
        when Occupation='Singer' then (@r3:=@r3+1)
        when Occupation='Actor' then (@r4:=@r4+1) end as RowNumber,
        case when Occupation='Doctor' then Name end as Doctor,
        case when Occupation='Professor' then Name end as Professor,
        case when Occupation='Singer' then Name end as Singer,
        case when Occupation='Actor' then Name end as Actor

FROM OCCUPATIONS
```

Step 4: Now, Order_by name then Group_By RowNumber.
Using Min/Max, if there is a name, it will return it, if not, return NULL.

```{sql}
set @r1=0, @r2=0, @r3=0, @r4=0;
```

```{sql}
select min(Doctor), min(Professor), min(Singer), min(Actor)
from(
  select case when Occupation='Doctor' then (@r1:=@r1+1)
            when Occupation='Professor' then (@r2:=@r2+1)
            when Occupation='Singer' then (@r3:=@r3+1)
            when Occupation='Actor' then (@r4:=@r4+1) end as RowNumber,
    case when Occupation='Doctor' then Name end as Doctor,
    case when Occupation='Professor' then Name end as Professor,
    case when Occupation='Singer' then Name end as Singer,
    case when Occupation='Actor' then Name end as Actor
  from OCCUPATIONS
  order by Name
	) temp
group by RowNumber;
```

## BST table

You are given a table, BST, containing two columns: N and P, where N represents the value of a node in Binary Tree, and P is the parent of N.

Write a query to find the node type of Binary Tree ordered by the value of the node. Output one of the following for each node:

* Root: If node is root node.
* Leaf: If node is leaf node.
* Inner: If node is neither root nor leaf node.

```{sql}
SELECT CASE
	WHEN P IS NULL THEN CONCAT(N, ' Root')
	WHEN N IN (SELECT DISTINCT P FROM BST) THEN CONCAT(N, ' Inner')
	ELSE CONCAT(N, ' Leaf')
	END AS NODE_TYPE
FROM BST
ORDER BY N ASC;
```
